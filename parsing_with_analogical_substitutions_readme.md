### More details about the project
By "exemplar-based", I mean that the grammatical analysis of a novel sentence should rely only on comparing it to attested sentences "on the fly", at the time of analysis. The method of comparison may involve complicated operations, but we should always be able to recover exactly which exemplars contributed to what part of the grammatical structure. In essence, for any novel sentence, the theory should be able to answer the question "What sentence fragments in the linguistic experience of a speaker contribute to their ability to parse this sentence"?

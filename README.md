# Analogical path models
Python implementations of exemplar-based theories of syntax and morphology.
- `syntax_model.py` parses sentences by recursively finding distributionally analogous corpus phrases for constituents, and
- `morphology_model.py` constructs novel inflected word forms of lexemes by transforming their attested word forms according to analogical word form pairs found in a corpus.

# Exemplar-based theories of language
Python implementations of exemplar-based theories of syntax and morphology.
- `syntax.py` parses sentences by recursively finding distributionally analogous corpus phrases for its constituents, and
- `morphology.py` constructs novel inflected word forms of lexemes by transforming their attested word forms according to analogical word form pairs found in a corpus.
